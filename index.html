					<p>I am basically a graduate civil engineer (NIT DGP 1987 pass out) with an experience of 35 years in the field 
						of construction and had the privilege of working with multiple giant construction companies in India. During 
						my tenure of service I was mainly entrusted with the execution of construction and project management and thus 
						gathered in-depth knowledge of project handling and management with nitty-gritty of contractual obligations of 
						clients as well as contractors. In the process I was fascinated by another aspect relating to techno commercial 
						and legal matters. I took special interest in resolving contractual complications arising out of extra item 
						claims, auditing, realizing long outstanding payments, negotiations etc.
						<br>
						<br>
						In the course of my long tenure of service with the mammoth construction companies, 
						I had got several opportunities to solve cases like contractual clarifications, helping my company in 
						getting extra work claims, to clarify and provide solution with techno commercial matters, interaction with 
						the audit team, resolving technical and contractual litigations etc.

				<p>Later I was intrigued to find that the big corporate houses are tactfully exploiting the medium and 
					smaller contractors contractually and financially, taking the advantage of their faith, simplicity and lack 
					of knowledge of taking steps for legal actions available for recovery of their hard earned money and finally 
					succumbing to the mighty bullying.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Like the big houses these marginal and medium resourceful contractors do not have their own technical or contractual 
					expertise capable of handling day-to-day project work or in-built systems, but blindly follow the instructions of 
					their clients agreeing to whatever rule they layout, with a hope of maintaining a good relation. In this process, 
					these contractors fall prey to the mercy of the employers and ultimately craftily cheated.</p>
				<br>
				<p>After getting the work done, the big houses keep a huge amount pending in the form of retention or showing warranty 
					periods which are not paid in due course. The contractors, when they realize that their outstanding amount will not 
					be cleared, are left with no options to recover their legitimate dues mainly due to lack of proper documentation of 
					evidence and paperwork. They start running from pillar to post, but get nobody to listen to their woes.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Our mission is to safeguard the interest of these contractors by showing future course of action paving way for 
					getting their payment and also make efforts so as to make the construction industry run in a healthy way and become 
					free of deceit. </p>
